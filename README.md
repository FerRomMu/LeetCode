# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  
I use it to practice algorithms, data structures, and general problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The problems are organized by difficulty level:

- `easy/`
- `medium/`
- `hard/`

Each folder contains individual `.py` files, one per problem.  
File names match the official LeetCode problem title, with spaces replaced by underscores.

Example:

easy/Two_Sum.py  
medium/Add_Two_Numbers.py  

## Notes

- Some problems may have multiple implementations to explore different trade-offs, such as time vs memory complexity, or readability vs efficiency.
- Docstrings include the complexity for each solution.
